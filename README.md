# 🌩️ Tropical Cloud Clusters (TCCs) Detection using AI/ML

This project presents an AI/ML-based system to identify and classify Tropical Cloud Clusters (TCCs) using half-hourly satellite data. The workflow combines **unsupervised clustering** with **Random Forest classification** to detect convective cloud systems and assess their severity using meteorologically interpretable features.

## 📌 Objectives

- Preprocess satellite-based cloud observation data
- Identify potential Tropical Cloud Clusters (TCCs)
- Apply clustering algorithms to group similar convective systems
- Use Random Forest classification to label and assess TCC severity
- Extract and interpret key meteorological features influencing classification

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

- **Clustering:**  
  - KMeans used to discover natural groups in the cloud system data
- **Classification:**  
  - Random Forest model trained on derived features to categorize TCCs into severity levels
